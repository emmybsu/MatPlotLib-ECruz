The three observations or insights about the data are:

1. There is only one outlier for the tumor volume across the four drugs.  That outlier is in Infubinol with a volume of 36.321346 mm3.
2. Capomulin causes a decrease with the tumor volume over a period of time.
3. As the weight increases in a mouse that is taking Capomulin, so does their tumor size.
